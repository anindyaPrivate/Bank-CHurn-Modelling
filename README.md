# Bank-CHurn-Modelling


It appears you've listed column names that might represent attributes in a dataset, possibly related to a banking or financial domain. Here's a brief description of each column:

RowNumber: An identifier for each row or record in the dataset.

CustomerId: A unique identifier for each customer.

Surname: The surname or last name of the customer.

CreditScore: The credit score of the customer, which reflects their creditworthiness.

Geography: The geographical location or country associated with the customer.

Gender: The gender of the customer (e.g., Male or Female).

Age: The age of the customer.

Tenure: The number of years the customer has been with the bank or institution.

Balance: The account balance of the customer.

NumOfProducts: The number of financial products (e.g., bank accounts, loans) the customer has with the bank.

HasCrCard: A binary indicator of whether the customer has a credit card (1 for Yes, 0 for No).

IsActiveMember: A binary indicator of whether the customer is an active member (1 for Yes, 0 for No).

EstimatedSalary: The estimated salary of the customer.

Exited: A binary target variable indicating whether the customer has exited or churned (left) the bank or institution (1 for Yes, 0 for No).

These columns appear to be typical features and a target variable in a dataset used for tasks such as customer churn prediction, where you might build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will exit or not based on their attributes.
